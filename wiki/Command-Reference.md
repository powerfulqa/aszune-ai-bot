   ```

2. **Reply to the bot**: Simply reply to one of the bot's messages with your follow-up question or
   comment.

## Advanced Features

### Emoji Reactions

The bot automatically adds emoji reactions to messages based on keywords it detects. Common keywords
include:

- "hello", "hi", "hey" ‚Üí üëã
- "funny", "lol", "haha" ‚Üí üòÑ
- "love", "heart" ‚Üí ‚ù§Ô∏è
- "sad", "unhappy" ‚Üí üò¢
- "game", "gaming" ‚Üí üéÆ
- "thanks", "thank you" ‚Üí üôè

### Rate Limiting

To prevent spam, the bot enforces a short cooldown period (typically a few seconds) between messages
from the same user. If you send messages too quickly, the bot will remind you to wait before
responding further.
