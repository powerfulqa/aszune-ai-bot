2. **Reply to the bot**: Simply reply to one of the bot's messages with your follow-up question or

## Advanced Features

### Emoji Reactions

The bot automatically adds emoji reactions to messages based on keywords it detects. Common keywords
include:

- "hello", "hi", "hey" ‚Üí üëã
- "funny", "lol", "haha" ‚Üí üòÑ
- "love", "heart" ‚Üí ‚ù§Ô∏è
- "sad", "unhappy" ‚Üí üò¢
- "game", "gaming" ‚Üí üéÆ
- "thanks", "thank you" ‚Üí üôè

### Message Features

#### Table Formatting

The bot automatically detects and formats tables in AI responses for better Discord readability:

- **Automatic Detection**: Recognizes markdown table patterns in AI responses
- **Discord Optimization**: Converts tables to organized bullet-point lists
- **Content Preservation**: Maintains all table data while improving display
- **Seamless Integration**: Works automatically without user intervention

**Example:**
```
AI Response with table:
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| /help   | Show help   |
| /stats  | Show stats  |

Becomes:
‚Ä¢ Command: /help, Description: Show help
‚Ä¢ Command: /stats, Description: Show stats
```

#### Long Message Chunking

When responses exceed Discord's character limits, the bot intelligently splits them:

- **Smart Boundaries**: Splits at paragraph and sentence boundaries
- **Clear Numbering**: Adds [1/3], [2/3] prefixes for sequence clarity
- **Content Integrity**: Preserves all information across multiple messages
- **URL Protection**: Keeps links intact across chunks

### Rate Limiting

To prevent spam, the bot enforces a short cooldown period (typically a few seconds) between messages
from the same user. If you send messages too quickly, the bot will remind you to wait before
responding further.
