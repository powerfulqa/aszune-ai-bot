## Asking Questions

To ask the bot a question about gaming lore, game logic, guides, or advice:

1. **Direct mention**: Mention the bot followed by your question

   ```text
   @AszuneBot What's the best build for a mage in Elden Ring?
   ```

2. **Reply to the bot**: Reply to one of the bot's messages with your follow-up question

## Long Responses

When the bot needs to provide a lengthy response, it will automatically split the message into
multiple parts to work within Discord's message character limits. Each part will be numbered like
`[1/3]`, `[2/3]`, `[3/3]` to indicate the sequence.

Example:

```
[1/2] This is the first part of a long response that has been automatically split by the bot's message chunking system. The chunking is done intelligently to preserve paragraph structure and sentence integrity...

[2/2] ...and this is the continuation of the response. The message chunking system ensures that words at the boundary between chunks are properly separated with spaces.
```

## Table Formatting

The bot automatically detects and formats tables in AI responses to make them more readable in
Discord. When the AI generates a response containing markdown tables, the bot converts them into
organized bullet-point lists for better Discord compatibility.

Example transformation:

```
Original table:
| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Analytics | ‚úÖ Active |
| Monitoring | ‚úÖ Active |

Becomes:
‚Ä¢ Feature: Analytics, Status: ‚úÖ Active
‚Ä¢ Feature: Monitoring, Status: ‚úÖ Active
```

## Conversation Context

The bot maintains a conversation history for each user, allowing it to remember context from
previous messages. This enables more coherent and contextual responses over time.

### Managing Your History

If you want to start a new conversation or clear your history:

```text
!clearhistory
```

or

```text
/clearhistory
```

## Summarizing Conversations

You can ask the bot to summarize your current conversation:

```text
!summary
```

or

```text
/summary
```

## Summarizing External Text

You can also ask the bot to summarize any text:

```text
!summarise <your text here>
```

or

```text
!summerise <your text here>
```

The bot will generate a concise summary in UK English.

## Viewing Your Stats

To see how many messages you've sent to the bot and how many summaries you've requested:

```text
!stats
```

or

```
/stats
```

```text
/resources
```

## Emoji Reactions

The bot will automatically add emoji reactions to your messages based on keywords it detects. For
example:

- "hello" might get a üëã reaction
- "funny" might get a üòÑ reaction
- "love" might get a ‚ù§Ô∏è reaction

These reactions are just for fun and help make interactions more engaging.

## Rate Limiting

To prevent spam, the bot enforces a short cooldown period between messages. If you try to send too
many messages too quickly, the bot will remind you to wait.

## Best Practices

- Ask clear, specific questions for better results
- Provide context when necessary
- Use the summary feature to keep track of long conversations
- Clear your history when starting a completely new topic
