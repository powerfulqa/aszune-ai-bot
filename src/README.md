## Architecture Improvements

### Modular Code Structure

The codebase has been reorganized into a modular structure:

```
src/
├── commands/     # Command handlers
├── config/       # Configuration files
├── services/     # External services and API clients
└── utils/        # Utility functions and helpers
```

### Data Storage & Persistence

- User statistics are now stored persistently in JSON files
- Data is automatically saved at regular intervals and on shutdown
- Automatic cleanup of old conversation history to prevent memory leaks

### Error Handling & Logging

- Centralised error handling with custom error messages
- Structured logging with timestamps and log levels
- Different handling strategies for different error types

### Performance Improvements

- Replaced plain objects with ES6 Maps for better performance
- Improved memory management with automatic cleanup
- Optimized API request handling

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- Discord Bot Token (from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- Perplexity API Key

### Setup Steps

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrishaycock/aszune-ai-bot.git
cd aszune-ai-bot
git checkout feature/code-improvements
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key
```

---

## Usage

### Running in Development Mode

To run the bot with automatic reloading on file changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running in Production

For regular execution:

```bash
npm start
```

For persistent execution with PM2:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```
