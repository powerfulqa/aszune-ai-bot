## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20.18.1 or later
- A Discord bot token (from the
  [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- A valid [Perplexity AI API key](https://www.perplexity.ai/)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chrishaycock/aszune-ai-bot.git
   cd aszune-ai-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file**

   ```env
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Database Setup (Automatic)**

   The bot automatically creates and manages a SQLite database for persistent data storage:
   - **Auto-created**: Database file is created automatically on first run
   - **Location**: `./data/bot.db` (configurable via `DB_PATH` environment variable)
   - **Tables**: User statistics and conversation history tables are created automatically
   - **No manual setup required**: The bot handles all database initialization

   Optional database configuration:

   ```env
   # Optional: Custom database path (defaults to ./data/bot.db)
   DB_PATH=./custom/path/bot.db
   ```

5. **Optional: License System (Feature Flagged)**

   The license validation system is currently **disabled by default** and behind feature flags for
   safe deployment. You can:
   - **Use without license**: Bot works normally with all v1.6.2 analytics features
   - **Enable license features**: Set environment variables to test license functionality
   - **Development mode**: Set `NODE_ENV=development` to enable all license features

   ```env
   # Optional License Configuration (disabled by default)
   ASZUNE_LICENSE_KEY=your_license_key_here

   # Enable specific license features for testing
   ENABLE_LICENSE_VALIDATION=true
   ENABLE_LICENSE_SERVER=true
   ENABLE_LICENSE_ENFORCEMENT=true

   # OR enable everything for development
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

   **License Registration** (when enabled):
   [Create License Registration](https://github.com/chrishaycock/aszune-ai-bot/issues/new?labels=license-registration&template=license-registration.md&title=Personal%20License%20Request)

---

## Usage

### Running the Bot Manually

```bash
node src/index.js
```

You should see:

```
Discord bot is online!
```

Your bot should now appear online in your Discord server.

### Running on Raspberry Pi 3

For optimal performance on Raspberry Pi 3, use the provided script:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x start-pi-optimized.sh

# Run with optimisations
./start-pi-optimized.sh
```

This script applies several performance optimisations:

- Sets memory limits appropriate for Pi 3
- Reduces CPU and memory usage
- Optimises network connections
- Configures compact mode for responses

For more details on Pi optimisations, see the
[Raspberry Pi Optimisation Guide](wiki/Pi-Optimization-Guide.md).

---

### Running with PM2 (for Production & Raspberry Pi)

PM2 keeps the bot alive in the background and restarts it on crashes or reboots.

#### Recommended: Using the Pi Optimisation Shell Script

To run the bot with full Raspberry Pi optimisations, use the provided shell script as your PM2 entry
point:

```bash
pm2 start start-pi-optimized.sh --name aszune-bot --interpreter bash
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

This ensures all Pi-specific environment variables and system-level tweaks are applied before
starting the bot, and enables automatic restart after a reboot.

**Note:** Running `pm2 start src/index.js` will NOT apply Pi optimisations. Always use the shell
script for Pi deployments.

## Testing & Coverage

The project includes comprehensive testing with Jest covering both standard functionality and branch
coverage, including full database integration testing. To run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run coverage

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run coverage

# Run branch coverage tests
npm run test:branch-coverage
```

The test suite includes:

- Unit tests for all service modules (including database service)
- Integration tests for bot functionality
- Database integration tests (SQLite operations, table creation, data persistence)
- Edge case handling tests
- Mocks for external dependencies
- Branch coverage tests for critical components
- Comprehensive conversation flow testing with database persistence

### Branch Coverage Testing

This project implements specific configurations for branch coverage testing:

- **Overall requirement**: 60% branch coverage threshold
- **Current metrics**:
  - index.js: 80% branch coverage
  - logger.js: 82.45% branch coverage (combined with branch coverage tests)

We use separate Jest configurations for branch coverage:

- `index-branch-coverage.jest.config.js` - For index.js testing
- `logger-branch-coverage.jest.config.js` - For logger.js testing

The `test:branch-coverage` script runs both configurations sequentially to ensure all core
components meet the coverage requirements. All branch coverage tests are now passing and properly
implemented.

For more detailed information about the testing strategy, see the
[Testing Guide](./wiki/Testing-Guide.md) and [**tests**/README.md](./__tests__/README.md).

Current test coverage: 82%+ overall with 1000 tests.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline:

1. **Builds** the application
2. **Runs all tests** with coverage reporting
3. **Performs security checks** using npm audit
4. **Uploads coverage data** to Codecov and QLTY
5. **Prepares for deployment** when merging to main branch

View the CI/CD workflow in `.github/workflows/unified-ci.yml`

---

## Troubleshooting

### 🔴 Bot Offline or Invalid Token

- Double-check your `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env`
- Confirm the token has not been regenerated or revoked
- Ensure your bot has permission to join and read messages in your server

### 🔴 Perplexity API Errors (400 / 401)

- Validate your API key is current and supports the `chat/completions` endpoint
- Ensure model name is `"sonar"` and the format of your payload is correct
- Test the same key using a tool like Postman or curl

---

## Notes

- The codebase has been completely refactored to use a modular structure under the `src/` directory.
- The bot uses a robust command handler for easier extension and maintenance.
- Conversation history and rate limiting are managed using JavaScript `Map` objects for better
  performance and reliability.
- The `!summarise <text>` command is available for summarising arbitrary text.
- Error handling and environment variable checks have been improved and centralised.
- The bot's system prompt instructs it to say "I don't know" if it cannot answer a question, rather
  than making up an answer.
