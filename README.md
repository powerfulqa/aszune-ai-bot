[Release Notes](./docs/README.md) | [Documentation Wiki](./wiki/Home.md)

**Aszune AI Bot** is a Discord bot designed to provide gaming lore, game logic, guides, and advice
using the Perplexity API with the **sonar** model. It maintains a short conversation history for
each user and adds fun emoji reactions based on keywords found in messages. Now supports both
traditional `!` commands and modern Discord slash commands. Optimised to run efficiently on
Raspberry Pi devices from Pi 3 to Pi 5.

  conversation using UK English. (Now robust to API requirements: last message must be from
  user/tool)
- 📝 **Text Summarisation:** `!summarise <text>` or `!summerise <text>` command generates a summary
  of any provided text using UK English.
- 🇬🇧 **UK English Responses:** All bot replies and summaries use UK English spelling and phrasing.

- 🔄 **Optimised Test Suite:** Fixed circular dependencies and improved mock implementations with
  82.45% branch coverage for critical components.
- 📝 **Smart Message Chunking:** Automatically splits long responses into multiple messages without
  content loss (v1.3.1-1.3.2)
  - 📊 **Intelligent Chunking:** Splits at paragraph and sentence boundaries to maintain context
  - 🔢 **Clear Numbering:** Adds "[1/3]", "[2/3]", etc. prefixes to indicate message sequence

  - 📋 **Full Content Delivery:** No more truncated responses, even for very long messages
  - 🔗 **Source Link Processing:** Enhanced handling of URLs and source references with proper formatting
  - 🎯 **Boundary Detection:** Intelligent chunking that avoids breaking content mid-sentence or mid-URL

- 🆕 **Raspberry Pi Optimisations:** Specialised performance optimisations for running on
  resource-constrained devices like Raspberry Pi 3.
  - 📉 **Memory Management:** Automatic garbage collection and memory monitoring
  - 🔄 **Message Debouncing:** Prevents excessive API calls
  - 📦 **Lazy Loading:** Loads heavy dependencies only when needed
  - 📊 **Connection Throttling:** Limits concurrent network connections

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20.18.1 or later
- A Discord bot token (from the
  [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- A valid [Perplexity AI API key](https://www.perplexity.ai/)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chrishaycock/aszune-ai-bot.git
   cd aszune-ai-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file**

   ```env
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key_here
   ```

---

## Usage

### Running the Bot Manually

```bash
node src/index.js
```

You should see:

```
Discord bot is online!
```

Your bot should now appear online in your Discord server.

### Running on Raspberry Pi 3

For optimal performance on Raspberry Pi 3, use the provided script:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x start-pi-optimized.sh

# Run with optimisations
./start-pi-optimized.sh
```

This script applies several performance optimisations:

- Sets memory limits appropriate for Pi 3
- Reduces CPU and memory usage
- Optimises network connections
- Configures compact mode for responses

For more details on Pi optimisations, see the
[Raspberry Pi Optimisation Guide](wiki/Pi-Optimization-Guide.md).

---

### Running with PM2 (for Production & Raspberry Pi)

PM2 keeps the bot alive in the background and restarts it on crashes or reboots.

#### Recommended: Using the Pi Optimisation Shell Script

To run the bot with full Raspberry Pi optimisations, use the provided shell script as your PM2 entry
point:

```bash
pm2 start start-pi-optimized.sh --name aszune-bot --interpreter bash
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

This ensures all Pi-specific environment variables and system-level tweaks are applied before
starting the bot, and enables automatic restart after a reboot.

**Note:** Running `pm2 start src/index.js` will NOT apply Pi optimisations. Always use the shell
script for Pi deployments.

> **Note:** While `!summarise` and `!summerise` exist as text commands, the `/summarise` slash
> command equivalent may not be fully implemented yet.

## Testing & Coverage

The project includes comprehensive testing with Jest covering both standard functionality and branch
coverage. To run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run coverage

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run coverage

# Run branch coverage tests
npm run test:branch-coverage
```

The test suite includes:

- Unit tests for all service modules
- Integration tests for bot functionality
- Edge case handling tests
- Mocks for external dependencies
- Branch coverage tests for critical components

### Branch Coverage Testing

This project implements specific configurations for branch coverage testing:

- **Overall requirement**: 60% branch coverage threshold
- **Current metrics**:
  - index.js: 80% branch coverage
  - logger.js: 82.45% branch coverage (combined with branch coverage tests)

We use separate Jest configurations for branch coverage:

- `index-branch-coverage.jest.config.js` - For index.js testing
- `logger-branch-coverage.jest.config.js` - For logger.js testing

The `test:branch-coverage` script runs both configurations sequentially to ensure all core
components meet the coverage requirements. All branch coverage tests are now passing and properly
implemented.

For more detailed information about the testing strategy, see the
[Testing Guide](./wiki/Testing-Guide.md) and [**tests**/README.md](./__tests__/README.md).

Current test coverage: 82%+ overall with 380+ tests.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline:

1. **Builds** the application
2. **Runs all tests** with coverage reporting
3. **Performs security checks** using npm audit
4. **Uploads coverage data** to Codecov and QLTY
5. **Prepares for deployment** when merging to main branch

View the CI/CD workflow in `.github/workflows/unified-ci.yml`

---

## Troubleshooting

### 🔴 Bot Offline or Invalid Token

- Double-check your `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env`
- Confirm the token has not been regenerated or revoked
- Ensure your bot has permission to join and read messages in your server

### 🔴 Perplexity API Errors (400 / 401)

- Validate your API key is current and supports the `chat/completions` endpoint
- Ensure model name is `"sonar"` and the format of your payload is correct
- Test the same key using a tool like Postman or curl

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add clickable sources and reference links from Perplexity results
- [ ] Enhance error handling with retry/backoff logic for API rate limits
- [ ] Web dashboard for usage monitoring and conversation history
- [ ] Implement AI-powered content moderation for safer interactions

## Notes

- The codebase has been completely refactored to use a modular structure under the `src/` directory.
- The bot uses a robust command handler for easier extension and maintenance.
- Conversation history and rate limiting are managed using JavaScript `Map` objects for better
  performance and reliability.
- The `!summarise <text>` command is available for summarising arbitrary text.
- Error handling and environment variable checks have been improved and centralised.
- The bot's system prompt instructs it to say "I don't know" if it cannot answer a question, rather
  than making up an answer.
