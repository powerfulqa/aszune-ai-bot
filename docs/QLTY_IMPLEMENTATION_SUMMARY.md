### 5. CI/CD Integration

#### `.github/workflows/unified-ci.yml` Updates:

- **Added qlty CLI installation** in the CI pipeline
- **Quality checks integration**:

  ```yaml
  - name: Run qlty quality checks
    run: qlty check --sample=20

  - name: Run qlty security scans
    run: |
      qlty check --plugin=gitleaks
      qlty check --plugin=trivy
  ```

- **Quality reporting**:
  - Generate quality metrics and code smells reports
  - Upload quality artifacts for analysis
- **Existing qlty coverage integration** maintained

## Quality Standards Established
