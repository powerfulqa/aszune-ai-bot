### 🟢 **Files That Remained in Root** (Required for GitHub/Standards):

- `README.md` - GitHub displays this automatically
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Standard location, referenced in wiki
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - GitHub looks for this here, referenced in wiki
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - GitHub looks for this here, referenced in wiki
- `SECURITY.md` - GitHub looks for this here, referenced in wiki

## 📝 **Updated Documentation**

### Updated `docs/README.md`:

- ✅ Fixed all internal links to point to correct file locations
- ✅ Added new sections for development documentation
- ✅ Organized release notes chronologically
- ✅ Added references to newly moved files

## 🧪 **Verification**

- ✅ All tests still pass after file moves
- ✅ No broken links in documentation
- ✅ GitHub standard files remain in expected locations
- ✅ Wiki references to root files still work correctly

## ✨ **Result**

The root directory is now **significantly cleaner and more professional**, containing only the
essential files that GitHub and development standards require to be in the root, while all
version-specific documentation and internal development docs are properly organized in the `/docs`
folder.

**Total files moved:** 11 markdown files **Root directory MD files reduced:** From 16 to 5 (69%
reduction) **Organization improvement:** All documentation now logically grouped by purpose
