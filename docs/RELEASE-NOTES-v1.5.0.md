## üöÄ Major Features

### Complete qlty Integration

- **Unified Quality Tooling**: Single configuration managing 8 specialized plugins
- **Centralized Configuration**: All quality settings consolidated in `.qlty/qlty.toml`
- **Seamless Integration**: Works alongside existing ESLint, Prettier, and Jest configurations
- **Developer Experience**: One command (`qlty check`) runs comprehensive quality analysis

### Multi-layered Security Scanning

- **Gitleaks**: Secret detection preventing accidental credential commits
- **Trivy**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning for dependencies
- **Semgrep**: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) for code vulnerabilities
- **Automated Prevention**: CI/CD integration blocks insecure code

### Critical Coverage Enforcement System

- **80% Coverage Requirement**: Automated enforcement on critical files via CI/CD
- **Build-Failing Protection**: Builds automatically fail if coverage drops below 80% on critical
  components
- **File-Specific Thresholds**: Individual 80% requirements for 7 identified critical files
- **Tiered Architecture**: Core files (index.js, config.js) have stricter enforcement than utilities

### Professional Documentation Standards

- **Security Policy** (`SECURITY.md`): Vulnerability reporting and security guidelines
- **Contributor Covenant** (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`): Community standards and behavior expectations
- **Contributing Guidelines** (`CONTRIBUTING.md`): Enhanced development workflow and standards
