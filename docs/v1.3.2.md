# Release Notes: Message Chunking Enhancement (v1.3.2)

## Overview

This release improves the message chunking functionality introduced in v1.3.1 by fixing a critical
bug that caused words at chunk boundaries to be incorrectly joined together. The enhancement ensures
that all messages are properly formatted and no content is lost when long responses are split across
multiple Discord messages.

## Bug Fixes

- **Word Boundary Preservation:** Fixed critical bug where words at chunk boundaries could be
  incorrectly joined (e.g., "selecting an" + "officer" → "selecting anofficer")
- **Space Handling:** Implemented intelligent space handling at chunk boundaries to ensure proper
  word separation
- **Content Integrity:** Ensured 100% content preservation when long messages are split into
  multiple chunks

## Technical Implementation

- **Boundary Detection:** Added word boundary detection logic to prevent text corruption at chunk
  boundaries
- **Enhanced Testing:** Added additional test cases to verify proper word separation at chunk
  boundaries
- **Code Refactoring:** Improved code organization for better maintainability

## Developer Notes

The enhanced algorithm now includes an additional post-processing step that examines each pair of
adjacent chunks. When a chunk ends with a word character and the next chunk begins with a word
character, a space is automatically added to prevent incorrect word joining.

Example:

- Before: "selecting an" + "officer" → "selecting anofficer"
- After: "selecting an" + "officer" → "selecting an officer"

This change is fully backward compatible with existing functionality.
