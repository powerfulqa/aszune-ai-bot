# Reminder Notification Fix - User Mention

## Issue

Reminder notifications were being sent to Discord channels but **users were not receiving
pings/mentions**, meaning:

- No notification sound
- No @ mention
- No direct message alert
- Users wouldn't notice the reminder unless they were actively viewing the channel

## Root Cause

The reminder notification code in `src/index.js` was sending only an embed message without
mentioning the user:

```javascript
// ❌ OLD CODE - No user mention
await channel.send({ embeds: [embed] });
```

Discord embeds alone do NOT trigger notifications. A user mention is required to ping the user.

## Solution

Added user mention to the reminder message using Discord's mention syntax `<@user_id>`:

```javascript
// ✅ NEW CODE - Includes user mention
await channel.send({
  content: `<@${reminder.user_id}>`,
  embeds: [embed],
});
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

- `src/index.js` - Reminder due handler (lines 83-107)

### Database Schema

The `reminders` table already includes the `user_id` field required for mentions:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reminders (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,  -- ✅ Available for mentions
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  scheduled_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
  timezone TEXT DEFAULT 'UTC',
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
  channel_id TEXT,
  server_id TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user_stats (user_id)
);
```

### Notification Flow

1. Reminder becomes due (time reached)
2. `ReminderService` emits 'reminderDue' event with reminder object
3. Event handler in `index.js`:
   - Fetches the Discord channel
   - Creates embed with reminder details
   - **Sends message with user mention** `<@${reminder.user_id}>`
   - User receives Discord notification (ping/sound/badge)

## Testing

All 47 reminder-related tests pass:

- ✅ Database reminder operations
- ✅ Reminder statistics
- ✅ Natural language reminder processing
- ✅ Reminder ID display

## User Experience

### Before Fix

```
⏰ Reminder!
test
Reminder set 10/8/2025 • Aszai Bot • Today at 13:00
```

❌ No notification, no ping

### After Fix

```
@Serv
⏰ Reminder!
test
Reminder set 10/8/2025 • Aszai Bot • Today at 13:00
```

✅ User receives notification, sees @ mention, gets pinged

## Deployment Notes

- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **Database Migrations**: None required
- **Backward Compatibility**: Full compatibility maintained
- **Feature Flags**: No new flags required

- [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs) - Mention formatting

## Verification Steps

1. Set a reminder: `!remind test in 1 minute`
2. Wait for reminder to trigger
3. Verify:
   - ✅ User receives Discord notification
   - ✅ User is @mentioned in the message
   - ✅ Embed displays correctly with reminder details

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

- [ ] Allow users to configure notification preferences (DM vs channel)
- [ ] Add option for silent reminders (no mention)
- [ ] Support reminder snoozing
- [ ] Add recurring reminder support
